                        <p>Hello! My name is Francesco, since I was young Iâ€™ve always been passionate about the world of technology
                            and the information that data can give us. I like to analyze data but above all that it has an attractive
                            design for a better understanding of the graphs and the information. Some tools that I use for data analysis
                            are <span> Excel</span>,<span> SQL</span>,<span> Power BI</span>, <span>Python </span>and their libraries. In Data science I work with <span>Python</span>  to create machine
                            learning models to identify patterns and make predictions. </p>
